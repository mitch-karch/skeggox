# Skeggøx: Automatic Scoring for Accuracy of Thrown Axes

Visually judging the location of an objects position is a difficult challenge and one that is fraught with heuristics and human error. 
Skeggøx aims to be an automated machine learning computer-vision based approach which will automatically score a users thrown axe against a regulation board, and eliminate any ambiguities in points scored.
